# Riding services pricing
Maximization of a profit from a ride-hailing service is simulated as a function of a payment to drivers. Drivers work more as a price goes up, so the dependency estimated with curve fitting. For each price in the range during 12 months, car pools of totally 10,000 potential riders simulated. Limitation of 1000 pulls per month taken into account. First, average of 30 simulations taken in price range 15-30 to find that optimal price is near 24. Then, 120 simulations per price in range 23-25 with smaller step. Optimal price found to be 24.00 with revenue 11,440.
